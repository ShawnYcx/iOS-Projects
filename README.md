# iOS-Projects
The purpose of this repository is to hold some personal iOS projects that I've worked on during my free time
to further familiarized myself with the Objective-C, Swift, and the development enviroment.

## CounselingApp
This application was built in Objective-C for the department of Psychology in Abilene Christian University to
help students who are under stress, depression, and to find help annonymously.

## PaoBlog
This applicat asdion is a messager application that is built with Swift and Firebase for the purpose of learning
the ways of using a NoSQL database as well as Swift. Building a messenger application is one way to have 
a deeper understanding of async data loading.
